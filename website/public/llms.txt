# Skills Desktop

> Skills Desktop is a free, open-source macOS Electron app that visualizes AI agent skill symlinks. It helps developers manage and monitor skills installed via `npx skills add` across 21 AI agents including Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and more.

Skills Desktop scans your `~/.agents/skills/` directory and displays the symlink status (valid, broken, or missing) for each skill across all supported AI agents. Built with Electron, React 19, Redux Toolkit, and TypeScript.
